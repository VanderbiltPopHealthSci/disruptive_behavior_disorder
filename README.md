# Disruptive Behaviors Disorder Meta-analysis

#### Christopher Fonnesbeck, Vanderbilt Biostatistics

## Key Question 1

>In children under 18 years of age treated for disruptive behaviors, are alpha-agonists, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, central nervous system stimulants, first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors more effective for improving short- term and long-term psychosocial outcomes than placebo or other pharmacologic interventions?

### Model inputs:
* indicators for intervention arm of study
* indicators for psychosocial outcomes (and associated time scale) study intervention effect size
* potential confounding variables

### Model outputs:

* posterior predictive distributions and derived statistics for meta-estimates of effect sizes for each psychosocial intervention
